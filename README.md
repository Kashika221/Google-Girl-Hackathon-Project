**PharmaPal - Disease Prediction Model**\
**Project Overview**\
PharmaPal is an AI-powered healthcare assistant that streamlines healthcare workows. It uses Optical Character
Recognition (OCR) to accurately interpret handwrien prescriptions and automatically matches medications with a
database to ensure safety. PharmaPal also analyzes medical images for diagnostics and predicts the likelihood of
diseases based on patient-reported symptoms, helping healthcare professionals detect conditions early and make
informed decisions for beer patient outcomes.

**Current Progress**\
Disease prediction system that uses machine learning to predict the likelihood of a disease based on input symptoms. This project contains a basic Random Forest classifier model that predicts whether a person has a particular disease based on their symptoms. The model has an 80% accuracy rate and is deployed using Flask for the backend with basic styling provided by CSS.

**Features**\
**Random Forest Classifier**: Predicts the presence of disease based on input symptoms.\
**Flask Web Application**: The model is deployed through a simple web application using Flask.\
**Basic Styling**: The web interface is styled using CSS for a clean, user-friendly experience.\
**Accuracy**: The model achieves 80% accuracy in predicting the presence of the disease based on a set of symptoms.\
**Technologies Used**
**Python**: Programming language used for machine learning and web development.\
**Flask**: Web framework for deploying the machine learning model.\
**Scikit-learn**: Python library used for building the Random Forest classifier.\
HTML/CSS: For building and styling the frontend of the web application.\
**Colab Notebook**: For model development and testing.\
**Model Details**
**Model Type**: Random Forest Classifier\
**Accuracy**: 80%\
**Features Used**: The model takes symptom data as input and predicts the likelihood of the disease.\
The model was trained on a mock dataset, and further improvements can be made by using a larger, more comprehensive dataset.

**Future Enhancements- Coming Soon**\
**Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**: to accurately interpret handwrien prescriptions\
**Model Improvement**: Enhance the model’s accuracy by using more sophisticated techniques, such as hyperparameter tuning or neural networks, or by using a larger, more representative dataset.\
**Advanced UI**: Develop a more interactive user interface with a cleaner design, and include features like real-time data validation and input error handling.\
**Mobile & Web Integration**: Extend the application’s accessibility by developing a mobile app and a more responsive web interface for broader user reach.\
**Telemedicine Integration**: Enable virtual consultations by integrating with telemedicine platforms, allowing doctors to review the symptom data and predictions.\
**Voice-Activated Interface**: Implement a voice-activated feature for users to input symptoms hands-free.\
**Automatic Medication Database Match**: Integrate with a medication database to suggest possible treatments based on the disease prediction.\
**AI-Powered Medical Imaging Analysis**: Expand the solution to include the ability to analyze medical images to assist in diagnosis.\
**Real-Time Data Storage**: Store input symptoms and predictions in a secure database for tracking health over time.\
